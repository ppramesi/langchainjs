# ChatBedrock

>[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that makes Foundation Models (FMs)
from leading AI startups and Amazon available via an API. You can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case.

## Setup

You'll need to install a few official AWS packages as peer dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @aws-crypto/sha256-js @aws-sdk/credential-provider-node @smithy/protocol-http @smithy/signature-v4 @smithy/eventstream-codec @smithy/util-utf8 @aws-sdk/types
```

## Usage

Currently, only Anthropic models are supported with the chat model integration. For foundation models from AI21 and Amazon, see [the text generation Bedrock variant](/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms/integrations/bedrock).

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import BedrockExample from "@examples/models/chat/integration_bedrock.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BedrockExample}</CodeBlock>
